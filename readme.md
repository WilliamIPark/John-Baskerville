## John Baskerville Project.

Each week I will build on this project as we learn HTML and CSS as part of IxD Belfast's IXD101 module.

### Part 01 HTML

#### 2nd November 2015
- [Version 1](http://williamipark.github.io/John-Baskerville/version1.html) - Marked up plain text file as HTML5 page.

#### 9th November 2015
- [Version 2](http://williamipark.github.io/John-Baskerville/version2.html) - Added a nested, unordered list at the end of the typeface section.
